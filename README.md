# CS460-MySQL-Programming-Assignments: PA1-3

This branch contains code for PA1-3. Please keep in mind the following:
  1. The sql dump file is named pa1-2.sql, as the database that was the deliverable for PA1-2 was conserved and used in this project, with a few modifications.
  2. GUI was implemented using Bootstrap HTML elements.
  3. We hope you enjoy the localhostMovieDb!
